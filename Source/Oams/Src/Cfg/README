Running CFG Test Cases
-----------------------


Steps to run CFG test cases:

	- Get base VNLBSC code from version controller and update it in your local directory structure. 

	-Set environment variable VNLBSC  to corresponding local VNLBSC directory structure.

	-Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to $VNLBSC/Bin/Host/CommonLib/

	-Run IPC Framework release 1.0.2 at backend.
         Follow IPC framework running procedure in this case.

	-Run Db Server v1.4 application at backend, delete any old generated *.dat files. 
         Follow Db running procedure to run Db server.

	-Run CFG executable cfg.exe from directory $VNLBSC/Source/Oams/Bin/Host/Exec
         Generate the executable by building make -f Makefile in $VNLBSC/Source/Oams/Src/Cfg/Src  

	-CFG Test stub code is placed in directory $VNLBSC/Source/Oams/TestStub/Cfg/Src

	-To generate the executable for CFG Test Stub, run the Makefile placed in above TestStub directory 
	 (as defined above).

	-CFG stub stub_cfg.exe will be genarated in  $VNLBSC/Source/Oams/Bin/Host/Exec , run this executable.

	- Run stub_cfg.exe give option ALL .
          All the test cases will get execute one by one.
          Each Test case result can be checked by the log displayed by the stub_cfg.exe process console. 

        - CFG logs 
          CFG logs will get generate @PRC_LOG/CFG_*.log
