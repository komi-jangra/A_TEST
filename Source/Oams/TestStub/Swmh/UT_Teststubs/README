Running SWMH Test Cases
-----------------------

Steps to run SWMH test stub


        -SWMH Test stub code is placed in directory $VNLBSC/Source/Oams/TestStub/Swmh/UT_Teststubs

        -To generate the executable for SWMH Test Stub, run the Makefile placed in above TestStub directory 
         (as defined above).
                For example : To generate test stub executable for ABIHM execute the command "make -f Makefile_ABIHM". 
                Similarly we can generate test stub executables for other stubs also.

        -Copy the test stub executables generated at the above path to /targetBin/repos/testStubs/ in the setup.

        -Run Stubs executables from the above path.

        -Each Test case result can be viewed in the PRC_LOG.
