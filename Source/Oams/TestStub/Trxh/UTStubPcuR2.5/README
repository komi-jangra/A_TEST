This document explains the procedure to run the Integrated Setup of TRXH and TestStubs ( CFG, ABIHM, GRHM, PSCH, BICH, CELLH).
Unit testing of TRXH has been performed using this setup.

Procedure to run setup:
-----------------------
Perform following steps to run the setup for testing:

    Run the new IPC Framework, it will also run the dbServer.

    Use Script_N_Packages to populate the data in dbServer.

    Run the binaries of TRXHandler on a terminals.
      e.g.  ./System_TRXHandler_apc.sct

    Run the executables for Test Subs of ABIHM, CFG on 
    different terminals from path  ./PCU/Source/Oams/TestStub/Trxh/UTStubPcuR2.5 
    Names of testStub Executables are : TestStubCfg, TestStubAbihm etc .

Procedure to compile Test stubs:
-------------------------------
    TestSubCfg    - make -f  Makefile_CFG
    TestSubAbihm  - make -f  Makefile_ABIHM
    TestStubGrhm  - make -f  Makefile_GRHM
    TestStubBich  - make -f  Makefile_BICH
    TestStubCellh - make -f  Makefile_CELLH
    TestStubPsch -  make -f  Makefile_PSCH
