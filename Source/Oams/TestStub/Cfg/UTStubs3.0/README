Instructions to compile CFG CS3.0 test stubs:
----------------------------------------

1. The CFG TestStubs are present at the following path:
   CS3.0/BSC-Development/Source/Oams/TestStub/Cfg/UTStubs3.0/
2. To generate the executable for CFG Test Stubs, run the Makefile for the TestStubs present in 
   following directory. 
	 -CmStub (It will generate Exe: CM_STUB)
   -OilStub (It will generate Exe: OIL_STUB)
   -SwmhStub (It will generate Exe: SWMH_STUB) 
   -AfhStub (It will generate Exe: AFH_STUB)
   -MgsStub (It will generate Exe: MGS_STUB)
   -TrxhBichStub (It will generate Exe: TRXH_BICH_STUB)

Execution Steps for Unit Testing of CFG:
----------------------------------------

1. Run IPC Framework.
2. Run MSGDUMPER and LOGGER so as to be able to generate PRC LOGS and DUMPER traces.
3. Delete all old .dat files and old logs.
4. Run DB server.
5. Run MGS_STUB
6. Run OIL_STUB
   For Software Offer, Activation and Delete, it will print a menu. 
   1.SUCCESS	2.FAILURE
   Give option 1, if you want to send Success in the response otherwise give option 2.
7. Run SWMH_STUB   
   For Software Download and Activation, it will print a menu. 
   1.SUCCESS	2.FAILURE
   Give option 1 for sending Ack and option 2 for sending Nack in the response.
8. Run AFH_STUB
9. Run TRXH_BICH_STUB
   A menu is printed on the screen, Give option 1
10.Run TRXH_BICH_STUB 
   A menu is printed on the screen, Give option 2
11.Run TRXH_BICH_STUB
   A menu is printed on the screen, Give option 3
12.Run CM_STUB
   A test case menu is printed on the screen.
        First enter the <Group Id> followed by <Test Case Id> to execute the test case(See Note 1).
        Each Test case result can be viewed in the PRC_LOG.
   This Test Stub need to be restarted for every Test Case.
13.Run the CFG Binary(Generated CFG Code).

Note 1:
------
 Test cases are divided into Groups:
1) Group Id-3: These contain SwUpgrade Test cases for Download and Activation.(From Test Case Id 1 to 98). 
2) Group Id-4: These contain Handover related test cases.(From Test Case Id 1 to 32). 
 Test case description can be viewed from VNL_BSC_UTP_UTR_CFG(CS3.0)_v0.2
