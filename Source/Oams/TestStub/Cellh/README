This document explains the procedure to run the Integrated Setup of CELLH and TestStubs ( CFG, ABIHM, GRHM, PSSCM, GRRM).
Unit testing of CELLH has been performed using this setup.
Procedure to run setup:
-----------------------
Perform following steps to run the setup for testing:

    Run the new IPC Framework, it will also run the dbServer.

    Use Script_N_Packages to populate the data in dbServer.

    Run the binaries of CELLHandler on a terminals.
      e.g.  ./System_CELLHandler_apc.sct

    Run the executables for Test Subs of ABIHM, CFG on 
    different terminals from path  ./BSC-Development/Source/Oams/TestStub/Cellh/ 
    Names of testStub Executables are : TestStubCfg, TestStubAbihm etc .

Procedure to compile Test stubs:
-------------------------------
    TestSubCfg    - make -f  Makefile_CFG
    TestSubAbihm  - make -f  Makefile_ABIHM
    TestStubGrhm  - make -f  Makefile_GRHM
    TestStubGrrm  - make -f  Makefile_GRRM
    TestStubPsscm - make -f  Makefile_PSSCM
    TestStubTrxh  - make -f   Makefile_TRXH
-------------------------------
