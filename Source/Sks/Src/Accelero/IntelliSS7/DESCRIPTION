IntelliSS7

IntelliSS7 provides a suite of vendor-neutral, language neutral, transport
neutral application programming interfaces for SS7 protocols.  The application
architecture provided by IntelliSS7 is inherently scaleable; deployed
applications range from a 50-subscriber Wireless Office to an 8 million
subscriber SCP.

Executables:
============
 o The "asnc" ASN.1 compiler to "C".
 o The "asncpp" ASN.1 compiler to "C++".
 o The "exc" exception compiler.
 o The "docgen" document generator.
 o The "DBGConsole" process controller/debugger.

Libraries:
==========
 o The "Support" library, a platform independent library for implementing
   multithread processes using sophisticated inter-thread and inter-process
   communication.
 o The "AsnC" library, which provides run-time support for the 'asnc' compiler.
 o The "AsnCpp" library, which provides run-time support for the 'asncpp'
   compiler.
 o The "DBGServer" library, which implements canned behavior for the
   'DBGConsole' application.  The server is inherently extensible.
 o The "MTP3" library, which provides ITU and ANSI interfaces for MTP3
   behavior.  Note that a significant amount of MTP3 behavior is actually
   provided by the 'Support' library.  'MTP3' provides both a "C" and "C++"
   interface.
 o The "ISUP" library, which provides an ITU interface for ISUP behavior.
   The library provides a vendor-independent interface to the
   ISDN User Part.  'ISUP' currently provides only a "C" interface, and
   uses the services of 'MTP3'.  Support for ANSI ISUP as well as a "C++"
   interface is planned for a future release.
 o The "SCCP" library, which provides ITU and ANSI interfaces for SCCP
   behavior.  The library provides a vendor-independent interface to the
   Signalling Connection Control Part.  'SCCP' provides both a "C" and "C++"
   interface, and uses the services of 'MTP3'.
 o The "TCAP" library, which provides ITU and ANSI interfaces for TCAP
   behavior.  The library provides a vendor-independent interface to the
   Transaction Capabilities Application Part.  'TCAP' provides both a "C"
   and "C++" interface, and uses the services of 'SCCP'.
 o The "INAP" library, which provides a vendor-independent interface for
   ITU INAP behavior.  Only the "C" interface is currently available,
   although the C++ interface is planned for a future release.
 o The "GSMMAP" library, which provides a vendor-independent interface for
   ETSI GSMMAP.  Currently only a "C" version is available; however, a
   C++ version is planned for a future release.
 o The "LIDB" library, which provides a vendor-independent interface for
   ANSI LIDB behavior.  Both "C" and "C++" interfaces are available.
 o The "AIN" library, which provides a vendor-independent interface for
   ANSI AIN 0.1 and parts of AIN 0.2.  Both "C" and "C++" versions are
   available.  Support for AIN 1.0 is planned for a future release.
 o The "IS41" library, which provides a vendor-independent interface for
   ANSI IS41 revision C.  Both "C" and "C++" versions are available.
 o The "IS634" library, which provides a vendor-independent interface for
   TIA IS634.  Both "C" and "C++" versions are available.

Supported platforms:
====================
Digital Unix 4.0D, HP-UX 10.20, Solaris 2.4, Linux 2.0 (RedHat 5.2),
Windows NT 4.0 (ServicePack 3).

Supported SS7 vendors:
======================
Natural Microsystems (Tx2000), DataKinetics, Digital (DECSS7), Excel (LNX),
IntelliNet (TCAP/SCCP over TCP/IP).  Other vendors can be supported with
minimal porting effort.
